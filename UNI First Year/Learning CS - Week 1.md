# Getting Started with Programming with Python

- Python is an high-level <u>programming language</u>, its instructions syntaxes are relatively easy for humans to read and understand compared to other programming languages
- The <u>console</u> is an environment to <u>execute </u> short <u>expressions </u> followed by the prompt (`>>>`)



## Getting started with the input

| Type     | name    | syntax                       | related common operators & other notes          |
|----------|---------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| integer  | `int`   | x                            | arithmetic operators, use (`//`) to return int  |
| decimals | `float` | x.x                          | arithemtic operators, use (`/`) to return float |
| boolean  | `bool`  | True, False                  | and, or, not                                    |
| string   | `str`   | 'abc'                        | ==, [x], arithemtic operator for repetition     |
| set      | `set`   | { } (set() for ∅) | ==, union, intersect, difference                |
| list     | `list`  | [ ]                          | ==, union, intersect, difference                |
| mapping  | `dict`  | {key: value}                 | ==, union, intersect, difference                |

- Float is an estimation of the result, it can easily cause **rounding errors**
- The syntax for boolean as to started with capital letter (`True` ≠ `true`)
- Set and Dictionary is unordered, while List is ordered 


## Memory Models
- <u>Variable</u> is a piece of code that is a name which refers to a stored value
- <u>Local variable </u> is a variable where the value is only stored in the local scope, it cannot be called upon through the global scope


### Functions & Comprehensions
- Set comprehension
   - *expr* **for** *variables* **in** *collection*
